User research scenario
======================

You have been working on a design sprint for your employer, The Ministry of
Dogs. The team have come up with several product ideas which they're now
starting to prototype so they can do some user-research.

The product manager has asked you to build a prototype of a new "product page"
for "Apply for a Barking Permit" (a new service the team want to test).

The rest of the team are busy building other things, so you're completely on
your own - the only help you have been given is one of the developers pointed
you at the GOV.UK Prototype Kit ([https://github.com/richardTowers/govuk_prototype_kit](https://github.com/richardTowers/govuk_prototype_kit))
and said something about it being "super easy to deploy now".

Your task
---------

1) Fork the prototype kit - [https://github.com/richardTowers/govuk_prototype_kit](https://github.com/richardTowers/govuk_prototype_kit)
2) Using the instructions in the prototype kit's README `https://github.com/$YOUR_GITHUB_USER/govuk_prototype_kit#readme`
   deploy the prototype kit so it's available on the internet
3) Edit the home page of the prototype kit so that it says the following and redeploy it


Apply for a Barking Permit
--------------------------

You're eligible for a barking permit if you have four legs, floppy or springy ears, or if you're a very good boy.

Applying takes about five minutes, you may need an animal with opposable thumbs to help you.
